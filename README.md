# Customer-behaviour-analysis

🚀 Excited to share my first project on machine learning classification using #Python, developed using #JupitorNotebook(IDE) 🤖💻

🔍 Project Overview: I worked on a classification problem using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will click on a social media add based on demographic features.

📊 Data Exploration:

Started by loading the dataset using pandas and checked its structure, statistics, and presence of missing values.
Explored the data distribution and correlations among features to understand the dataset better.
⚙️ Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance effectively.
Utilized StandardScaler to standardize the features, ensuring each feature contributes equally to the model.
🤖 Model Selection and Training:

Implemented three popular classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
Trained each model on the training data and fine-tuned their hyperparameters for optimal performance.
📈 Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the models' performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
📊 Visualization:

Visualized the confusion matrix to gain insights into the models' predictive capabilities and areas of improvement.
🔮 Prediction:

Demonstrated how the trained models can be used to make predictions on new data, showcasing the practical application of the project.
🌟 Key Achievements:

Achieved impressive accuracy scores on the test set, indicating the models' effectiveness in predicting ad clicks.
K NearestNeighbor-91.25%,Support Vector Machine-92.5%,
Naive Bayes-93.75%
Successfully deployed a machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.
💡 Key Takeaways:

Importance of data preprocessing techniques like feature scaling for enhancing model performance.
Understanding the strengths and limitations of different classification algorithms for solving real-world problems.
